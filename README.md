latex2Mathematica
==================
Converts Latex-style Math to Mathematica-style math.

Useful for one of my [Netmath](https://netmath.illinois.edu/) courses which requires [CAS-ILE](https://netmath.illinois.edu/information/CAS-ILE) for text answers.

For math formatting, this requires verbrose Mathematica-style code like `OverVector[Subscript[v,1]]` instead of `\vec{k_1}`


This can get very verbose after a while (and I keep having to look up commands).

This program exists to do the conversions ;)
